# FortiPhantom

**FortiPhantom** is a personal project I've been working on to learn more about how network blocks and Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) work, specifically in Fortinet environments. The goal of this tool is to help understand how misconfigurations in network settings can allow someone to bypass restrictions, and how spoofing techniques can affect DPI. Everything here is for **educational purposes only** I’m using it to grow my own knowledge in network security.

## What is FortiPhantom?

FortiPhantom is a windows only tool and is designed to help me and other learn more about how Fortinets Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) works on multiple layers and how to manipulate those layers to get around network restrictions and understand windows internals more.

It’s really about learning how weak network configurations can be exploited. I’m testing out different ways to see how these settings impact a network’s ability to recognize devices.
